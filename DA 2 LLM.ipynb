It is a type of decision tree, which is a tree-like model that splits the data into subsets based on the values of certain features. The goal of the tree is to classify the data into different classes based on the features.\n",

      "\\item It splits the data into two subsets based on the values of the selected feature.\n",
      "\\item It repeats the process for each subset until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples in each subset.\n",

However, it can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the maximum depth of the tree and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Additionally, the tree can become very large and difficult to interpret if the data is high-dimensional or if there are many features.\n",

      "Response: ? In linear regression, we try to model the relationship between two continuous variables, typically denoted as X and Y. The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the value of Y based on the value of X. This is done by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values of Y, which is known as the sum of squared errors (SSE). The linear equation takes the form of a linear combination of the independent variable, X, with a set of coefficients that are estimated from the data. The equation is typically written as:\n",

      "Answer: Linear regression is a simple technique that tries to predict a continuous outcome (like a price or a score) by using one or more predictor variables (like age, income, or location). It's called \"linear\" because the relationship between the predictors and the outcome is assumed to be a straight line. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that explains the relationship between the variables. This line is called the \"regression line\". By using the regression line, you can make predictions about the outcome for new, unseen data.\n",

      "What is linear regression, and how does it work?\n",
      "Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (also called the outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictor variables). It is a fundamental concept in machine learning and data analysis, and is widely used in many fields, including finance, economics, and social sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we'll explore what linear regression is, how it works, and some of its key assumptions and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is linear regression?\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear regression is a linear model that predicts the value of a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. The model assumes that the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable is linear, meaning that the change in the outcome variable is proportional to the change in the predictor variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The linear regression model can be represented as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + … + ε\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Y is the outcome variable (dependent variable)\n",
      "* X1, X2, … are the predictor variables (independent variables)\n",
      "* β0 is the intercept or constant term\n",
      "* β1, β2, … are the slope coefficients that represent the change in the outcome variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variables\n",
      "* ε is the error term, which represents the random variation in the outcome variable that is not explained by the predictor variables\n",
      "\n",
      "How does linear regression work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear regression works by finding the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values of the outcome variable. This is achieved through an optimization process that adjusts the values of the slope coefficients and the intercept term to find the combination that results in the smallest sum of squared errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several algorithms that can be used to perform linear regression, including ordinary least squares (OLS), ridge regression, and lasso regression. OLS is the most widely used algorithm and is the default method in many statistical software packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key assumptions of linear regression\n",
      "\n",
      "Linear regression assumes that the data satisfies the following conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable is linear.\n",
      "2. **Independence**: Each observation is independent of the others.\n",
      "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the error term is constant across all levels of the predictor variables.\n",

In your case, `X` has shape `(4, 2)`, but `LinearRegression` expects `X` to have shape `(4, 1)`. You can fix this by reshaping `X` to `(4, 1)` using `X = X.reshape(-1, 1)`. This will tell `LinearRegression` that each sample has only one feature.\n",
